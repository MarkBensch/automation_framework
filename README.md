# Genereral Automation Framework Template
This is a project I am writing so I do not need to reinvent the wheel everytime I need to make automation tests.

### TODO:
* multi-browser execute not just FF
* Remote driver execution
    * grid
    * browser stack
    * sauce Labs
* Mobile execution 
* Config File
* Gradle cleanup
* API work 
    * not sure what this will be
* database connection
* logging
* other stuff that I have not thought about at this time
